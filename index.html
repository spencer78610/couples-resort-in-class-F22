                    <p>"Thank you for your interest in our Couples Resort.  
                        Here you will find the time to spend quality time together, 
                        and this is why we exist, to be here, so that you can spend 
                        lots of time together.  We, the LeBlanc Family, started in 1958
                         to take care of guests, in 1987 we moved to couples only 
                         (no kids and no meetings/conferences) as we knew that many 
                         couples needed special time together.  In 2008, Canada Select
                        which was rating 5000 accommodation properties in Canada, 
                        decided we should join them because we were easily in the 
                        top 1%, a 5 Star, and we are glad we made it for you to 
                        enjoy as you deserve it.  Now, many times of the year, 
                        we offer rates super discounted as we wish to be accessible 
                        to as many couples as possible, as all couples should benefit 
                        from quiet time together.  We have learned over the decades 
                        from our guests that those guests that have a love for gratitude 
                        for each other and for their surroundings are the happiest people, 
                        daily I ask how grateful am I, and I hope you are filled with many 
                        things that you are grateful for.  If you know other couples who 
                        need time away please pass on the word."</p>
